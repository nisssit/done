  <p>  *What is No Rush shipping?</p>
<span>No Rush shipping means exactly that: no rush. We decided to take the benefits of ground-only shipping and make it available for anyone. Why? Because, on average, ground-only shipping is less carbon-intensive than air freight shipping. Plus, No Rush gives our teams a little extra time to prepare your order and get it out the door. We’ll still provide an estimated delivery date during checkout, so you’ll know when to expect your order. On rare occasions, there may be some operational overrides that cause your package to ship on a plane, but we’ll do our best to get your order shipped ground.

  Sneakers went international in 1924. That’s when a German man named Adi Dassler created a sneaker that he named after himself: Adidas. This brand became the most popular athletic shoe in the world. Track star Jessie Owens wore Adidas when he won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics. Adi’s brother Rudi started up another famous sports shoe company: Puma.

<br>During the first half of the 20th century, sports shoes were worn mostly to play sports. But in the 1950s, kids began wearing them as fashion statements. Even more teens followed the fad after seeing James Dean in sneakers in the popular movie Rebel Without a Cause.

Innovation at a Price
Sales of sneakers really took off in 1984, when Michael Jordan signed a contract to wear a Nike shoe called Air Jordans—the most famous sneaker ever made. Even after Jordan retired from the NBA, his shoes continued to be best sellers. As companies like Nike, Reebok and Adidas competed, they changed the way sneakers looked, adding wild colors and doing away with laces. Sneakers began to be produced for every sport, including walking, skateboarding and “cross training.”

New sneaker technologies increase performance. Nike’s Air Force used little pockets of gas to create better cushioning, while Reebok introduced The Pump—air pumped into shoes to make them fit more snugly. Sneaker surprises continue: Spira Footwear, for example, has built a spring in the soles to reduce foot stress. Of course, innovations like these come with a price: Athletic shoes often cost more than $100 a pair!</p>
